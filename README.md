## What is this?

**Claude Skills** are pre-built prompts that give Claude Code specialized abilities — SEO audits, code reviews, PPT generation, data analysis, and more. Each skill is a single markdown file that drops into your `.claude/commands/` directory.

Think of it as **an app store for Claude Code**.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install a single skill
npx claude-skills install code-review

# Install all marketing skills (10 skills)
npx claude-skills install-pack marketing

# Install everything (36+ skills)
npx claude-skills install-pack all

# Browse available skills
npx claude-skills list

# Search
npx claude-skills search "seo"
```

Then in Claude Code, use the skill:
```
